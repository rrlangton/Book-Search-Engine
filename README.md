# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

This a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's set up to allow users to search for books and to save book searches to the back end. The user can also view their saved books on another page. To make this application functional I have refactored the API to use GraphQL on the back end and added some functionality to the front end.
